## Overview

The **Image Comparer Slider** addresses the clutter of traditional comparison workflows. **It is the perfect tool for users who rely heavily on Refiners and Upscalers**, allowing you to check subtle differences instantly.

It replaces manual wiring and gallery reloading with a single, intelligent node that adapts to your graph.

| Core Capabilities | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Dynamic Inputs** | Slots are generated on-demand. Connect a wire, and a new slot appears automatically. |
| **Auto-Compaction** | Disconnecting a source automatically reorganizes the inputs to remove gaps. |
| **Native Integration** | A custom-rendered slider within the node allowing for precise "Before/After" analysis. |
| **Performance** | Built-in Javascript caching ensures 60fps scrubbing with no server round-trips. |
