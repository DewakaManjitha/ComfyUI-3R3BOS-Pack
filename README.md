## 📦 The Collection

This pack is designed to grow. Currently, it includes two core tools focused on UX and Efficiency.

---

### 1. Visual Gatekeeper (Logic)
**"Stop wasting GPU time on bad generations."**
The Visual Gatekeeper brings a true "Pause" button to ComfyUI. It halts the workflow after an initial generation, allowing you to approve or reject the image before sending it to expensive Refiners or Upscalers.

* **Human-in-the-Loop:** Grants you manual control over the generation pipeline.
* **Clear UX:** Large preview with prominent **APPROVE** (Green) and **REJECT** (Red) buttons.
* **Resource Saving:** Instantly cancels the rest of the workflow if the image is rejected.

> **Node Name:** `Visual Gatekeeper`
> **Menu:** `3R3BOS/Logic`

### 2. Image Comparer Slider (Visualization)
**"The ultimate A/B testing tool."**
A high-performance slider to compare Checkpoints, LoRAs, or "Before/After" Upscaling results with zero latency.

#### 🎥 Slider Demo

* **Dynamic Inputs:** Automatically creates up to 20 input slots as you connect wires.
* **Zero-Lag:** Client-side caching ensures 60fps scrubbing.
* **Auto-Compaction:** Smart inputs reorganize themselves if you disconnect a source.
